# VRR Quick Register

A QR landing page that helps visitors register parking faster:
- Saves visitor info on their phone (license plate, make/model, name/email)
- Opens VRR Step 1 and copies Apartment name
- Copies Step 2 field values in a single block to paste easily

## Setup
1) Put your VRR Step 1 link into: js/app.js → VRR_STEP1_URL
2) Host the project (GitHub Pages is easiest)
3) Generate a QR code that points to your hosted link

## Example QR link
https://YOURNAME.github.io/vrr-quick-register/?apt=Hebron%20121%20Station&resident=Martin&unit=101
